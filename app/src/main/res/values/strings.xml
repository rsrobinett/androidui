    <string name="assignment">In this assignment you need to make an app that has 5 different activities. The main activity is a list of buttons, each of which will launch a new activity within the app.

Each of those activities should display at least 5 elements in a different way. The elements can be entirely at your choosing.

A minimal example that fully meets the requirements would be displaying the numbers 1 through 5 in a LinearLayout (horizontal and vertical), a GridLayout and a RelativeLayout.

Alternatively you could replace one or more of those with Views bound to Adapters if you wanted to get a little more advanced with your implementation. For example you could use a RecyclerView to display a infinite list of numbers.

Deliverables:

You should zip up the entire project directory and submit it as a zip file (you should not include the directories created by building, we just want the source code). You should also record a video demonstrating the functionality of your project. This can be uploaded to media.oregonstate.edu and a link to the video submitted as a comment along with the assignment.
